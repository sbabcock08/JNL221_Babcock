<p>	In 2023 the United States saw another record high number of school shootings. This year there were more than 330 incidents, according to the K-12 School Shooting Database which accounts for all times (regardless of victims, time, or day) a gun is fired, brandished, or a bullet hits school property.
</p>
<p>
The database shows that a large increase in school shootings is a common trend following the beginning of the pandemic in 2020. Within the last three years, school shootings have risen by 1.87%. This is a large jump from previous years where the number of occurrences never surpassed 120 times a year, according to the K-12 School Shooting Database.

<p>“[This year has] been very similar to the last couple post COVID years. There is a slight increase in the number of incidents so it's not going down. We're on a curve where this year is going to be 10% higher than last year. It's tough to tell exactly where the year will end, but it's not going in the right direction,” David Riedman, founder of the K-12 School Shooting Database, said. “They're not significantly fewer, they're more and that's been the pattern for the last five years. There are more shootings each year.”</p>
<p>Since Columbine, more than 359,000 students have been on campus during a school shooting, according to an article from The Washington Post. Gun violence not only impacts its victims, their loved ones, and the surrounding community. A study conducted from 2020-2021 found out of the 2,263 students surveyed, the majority reported being extremely concerned, stressed, and worried about school shootings occurring at their prospective schools. Additionally, after Columbine took place in 1999, researchers reported that 30% more students claimed they felt unsafe at school, compared to national survey data collected before the shooting.</p>
<p>The upward trend of school shootings in America as well as little action on the federal level presents a larger issue for our country. Riedman stated that schools are making an effort to increase security levels by putting funding towards metal detectors, higher police presence during school hours, and requiring kids to wear clear backpacks to school. Although security measures are being taken to protect students, “the things that are being implemented and the things that are being done are not successful,” Riedman said.</p>
<p>“You can put more and more money towards that physical security but the number of instances keep going up,” Riedman said.</p>
<p>Riedman shared that the majority of school shootings take place outside of schools. Out of more than 2,000 recorded incidents, around 700 solely happened inside the building, as indicated by the K-12 School Shooting Database. Therefore, efforts made by schools are not necessarily preventing these mass shootings from occurring.</p>
<p>There are steps that our government and school systems can take to protect students and reduce a large number of shootings. Riedman explained that stricter safe storage laws and consequences for a gun owner if a child or teenager uses their weapon. Additionally Riedman said he believes schools would benefit from crisis intervention programs to stop a problem from escalating early on.</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p class="pq"><i>“When we don't have powerful red flag laws, we don't have any way for the people that see the warning signs to then be able to take action to prevent somebody from committing violence. That's the other part of where that falls apart. People see the signs but unless there's legal opportunities to make sure that person doesn't buy or doesn't possess a weapon, it's all kind of pointless. Within the school itself, if you have crisis intervention programs that can also help people realize that there's somebody that's going down the path where they might eventually get to violence,” Riedman said.</i></p>

<p>Additionally, there has been an increase of school shootings on college campuses not accounted for by the K-12 School Shooting Database.</p>
<p>In the beginning of 2023, a shooting at Michigan State claimed the lives of 3 students and injured multiple others. Then a professor was shot at the University of North Carolina Chapel Hill, and then the campus went into another lockdown two weeks later. The most recent campus shooting happened at the beginning of December at the University of Las Vegas Nevada taking three lives.</p>
<p>Maya Lubelfeld, sophomore at Michigan State, was on campus when the shooting took place. Lubelfeld said being there during a shooting was an “indescribable feeling.” She and her sorority sisters were driving home from their sorority house when they were alerted that there was an active shooter in the area.</p>
<p>“As soon as I got a notice that there was an active shooter on campus, everything froze. The terror in my friends eyes and voices is something that I will never be able to get out of my head. It felt so surreal that this was happening to us on our campus,” Lubelfeld said. “As I got into my friend's dorm everyone was so scared and it was one of the scariest moments of my life. As all of us listened to the police scanner saying that the shooter was buildings away from us, we held each other close, texted our loved ones, and just prayed for the best.”</p>
<p>Lubelfeld said  February 13th, 2023 is a day she will never forget, and she “will always be proud to be a spartan and have a university as strong as mine,” Lubelfeld said. Riedman shared that he believes those who have lived these experiences, like Lubelfeld, are the key to substantial change in policy.</p>
<p>“I think that there will eventually be change, but how long it takes to get there is the biggest question,” Riedman said. “As long as there are a lot of influential people that are essentially paid by the gun industry to ignore this as an issue, then really nothing changes.</p>
